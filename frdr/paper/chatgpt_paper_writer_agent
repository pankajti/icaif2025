I wrote a paper using fed speeches data and collected data using webscrapper and used llm to
tag emaphasis using the methodologies mentioned in the atttached paper AIFIN-2025_paper_22.pdf.
I want to write a different paper but retain the description of how I prepared data for my analysis.
This time I want to use following attached data :
fed_speeches_emphasis_score.csv which contains fed speeches tags,
CPIAUCSL.csv which contains fred cpi data
and UNRATE.csv which contains unemployment rate data.

The topic for new paper is "Does Fed focus on employment/inflation precede, lag, or simply track the real economy?"

The paper template is : acm_template.tex

Can you write a paper in desired format?



Chatgpt version :

I previously wrote a paper (attached as AIFIN-2025_paper_22.pdf) using LLMs to analyze Federal Reserve speeches, focusing on narrative emphasis classification. I scraped and preprocessed the data myself using a custom pipeline.

Now, I want to write a new research paper using the same preprocessing and tagging methodology from the earlier paper, but applying it to a new question:

"Does Fed focus on employment/inflation precede, lag, or simply track the real economy?"

Please use the following datasets:

fed_speeches_emphasis_score.csv: Contains tagged emphasis scores per speech

CPIAUCSL.csv: Monthly CPI data from FRED

UNRATE.csv: Monthly unemployment rate from FRED

The paper should:

Reuse the original data preparation pipeline (briefly describe it in the methods section)

Clearly frame the new research question and hypothesis

Describe how CPI and Unemployment Rate are aligned with the emphasis scores over time

Include statistical tests or visualization logic (e.g., rolling correlation, lag analysis)

Follow the ACM template from acm_template.tex

Please write the full paper including title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and references (with dummy citations if needed).

Start from scratch â€” the content should not overlap with the earlier submission beyond data methodology.
